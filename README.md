# KIT PSE: Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

## Reports

All reports are written using LaTeX, and can be found in the `reports` subdirectory. To build the
files, you can either use [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), or install the following dependencies:

- texlive-basic
- texlive-fontsextra
- texlive-langgerman
- texlive-latex
- texlive-latexrecommended
- texlive-latexextra
- texlive-plaingeneric

To build the reports, run:

```bash
make
```

You might have to run this command twice to get the table of contents right.
