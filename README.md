All reports are written using LaTeX, and can be found in the `reports` subdirectory. To build the
files, you can either use [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), or install the following dependencies:

- texlive-basic
- texlive-fontsextra
- texlive-langgerman
- texlive-latex
- texlive-latexrecommended
- texlive-latexextra

Then, build using the following command in the `reports` directory:

```bash
pdflatex techreport.tex
```
